Notable changes
===============

Reduce upload traffic
---------------------

A major part of the outbound traffic is caused by serving historic blocks to
other nodes in initial block download state.

It is now possible to reduce the total upload traffic via the `-maxuploadtarget`
parameter. This is *not* a hard limit but a threshold to minimize the outbound
traffic. When the limit is about to be reached, the uploaded data is cut by not
serving historic blocks (blocks older than one week).
Moreover, any SPV peer is disconnected when they request a filtered block.

This option can be specified in MiB per day and is turned off by default
(`-maxuploadtarget=0`).
The recommended minimum is 1152 * MAX_BLOCK_SIZE (currently 2304MB) per day.

Whitelisted peers will never be disconnected, although their traffic counts for
calculating the target.

A more detailed documentation about keeping traffic low can be found in
[/doc/reducetraffic.md](/doc/reducetraffic.md).

Direct headers announcement (BIP 130)
-------------------------------------

Between compatible peers, BIP 130 direct headers announcement is used. This
means that blocks are advertized by announcing their headers directly, instead
of just announcing the hash. In a reorganization, all new headers are sent,
instead of just the new tip. This can often prevent an extra roundtrip before
the actual block is downloaded.
